# Caesar-Cipher

This program allows for encryption/decryption of text via CaesarCipher. The program can be used by opening the index.html in the browser. 
The upper input bar is for inputting text and the lower input bar is for positive or negative numbers by which the text should be encrypted/decrypted by. 
If the input number is above 26 it will loop back around the alphabet. By clicking the Encrypt Button you will be given the encrypted text in the output bar on the bottom and with the reset button can you reset both fields.
Currently the program isnt tested for all kinds of input failsafes.
